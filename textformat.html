    <p>Water is one of the most important substances on Earth. Its chemical formula is <i> H<sub>2</sub>O, </i>
        which means it contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. 
        Another simple compound is carbon dioxide, represented as <i>CO<sub>2</sub>.</i>

    <h6>Para Six</h6>
    <p>One of the most common formulas in mathematics is the area of a rectangle:

    Similarly, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
    Perimeter = 2 × (length + width).</p>
